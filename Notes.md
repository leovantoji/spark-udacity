## The Power of Spark
Spark is currently one of the most popular tools for big data analytics. You might have heard of other tools such as Hadoop. Hadoop is a slightly older technology although still in use by some companies. Spark is generally faster than Hadoop, which is why Spark has become more popular over the last few years.

Distributed vs Parallel computing:
- In general, parallel computing implies multiple CPUs share the same memory.
- With distributed computing, each CPU has its own memory.
- In distributed computing, each computer/machine is connected to the other machines across a network.
